# Reference Masker Implementation Plan

## Overview
A phased approach to building a production-ready virus masking tool for reference genomes.

## Phase 1: Minimal Viable Pipeline (Week 1)
1. **Start with a single Snakefile** containing your existing rules
2. **Test with one reference genome** and your NCBI virus database
3. **Use hardcoded parameters** initially
4. **Focus on core functionality**: shred → map → mask

### Deliverables
- Working Snakefile with three core rules
- Successfully masked reference genome
- Basic logging output

## Phase 2: Configuration & Flexibility (Week 2)
1. **Extract parameters to config.yaml**
2. **Add input validation** 
3. **Implement multi-reference support** using wildcards
4. **Modularize rules** into separate files

### Deliverables
- Configuration-driven pipeline
- Support for multiple reference genomes
- Modular rule structure
- Input validation script

## Phase 3: Reporting & Analysis (Week 3)
1. **Add basic statistics** (% masked, region counts)
2. **Generate BED files** of masked regions
3. **Create simple visualizations** (matplotlib/seaborn)
4. **Build HTML report** with MultiQC or custom template

### Deliverables
- Comprehensive statistics output
- BED format masked regions
- Visualization plots
- HTML summary report

## Phase 4: Production Ready (Week 4)
1. **Add comprehensive error handling**
2. **Implement logging system**
3. **Create test datasets**
4. **Write documentation**

### Deliverables
- Robust error handling
- Structured logging
- Test suite with example data
- User documentation
- Developer documentation

## Key Milestones
- **End of Week 1**: Core pipeline functional
- **End of Week 2**: Flexible configuration system
- **End of Week 3**: Full reporting capabilities
- **End of Week 4**: Production-ready tool

## Success Criteria
- Pipeline runs end-to-end without errors
- Results are reproducible
- Performance is acceptable for genome-scale data
- Output is validated against known viral regions
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive
